## About Me

I am a Senior at Cornell University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics, Operations Research, and Game Design. I am graduating in the spring of 2024, and plan to continue to graduate school. I am particularly interested in Algorithms and Theory in Computer Science. I also have a passion for art; including painting, drawing, sculpting, and photography. You can find some of my work below! My emails are kg556@cornell.edu and kyra.gunluk@gmail.com, and you can find me on [Linkedin here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyra-gunluk-097704198/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. You can also find more about my teaching and work experiences through my [resume](files/resume.pdf)

## Research Interests
I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science and Optimization. I have worked on research in Algorithmic Game Theory, and have enjoyed studying problems in Optimization, Combinatorics, and Aproximation Algorithms.

In the Fall of 2022, I joined a research project with professor Eshan Chattopadhyay on Fourier Bounds for Parity Decision Trees (PTDs). The goal of this project is to improve current bounds on the complexity of Fourier expansions of boolean functions on binary strings. 

In the Summer of 2023, I was accepted to the Distributed REU program with the Computing Research Association. I received funding to spend 10 weeks at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and work with Professor Ruta Mehta on research in Algorithmic Game Theory. We worked on the problem of Fair Allocation and explored different measurements of fairness in different problem settings. You can find more information about our results through our [paper](files/ApproximatingMMSandAPS.pdf) and [poster](files/Fairness_Poster.pdf).

I plan to continue exploring research in Theoretical CS, Algorithms, Optimization, and more through pursuing a PhD.
