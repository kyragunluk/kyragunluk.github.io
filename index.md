## About Me

I am a second year PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, studying [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization](https://aco.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I am particularly interested in Algorithms and Theory in Computer Science, and I am currently exploring research problems in Approximation Algorithms with my advisor [Santosh Vempala](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

I previously studied at Cornell University's College of Engineering, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2024. I recieved a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics, Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE), and Game Design.

I also have a passion for art; including painting, drawing, sculpting, and photography. You can find some of my work below! My emails are kgunluk3@gatech.edu and kyra.gunluk@gmail.com, and you can find me on [Linkedin here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyra-gunluk-097704198/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. You can also find more about my teaching and work experiences through my [resume](files/resume.pdf)

## Research Interests
I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science and Optimization. I have worked on research in Deterministic Approximation Algorithms and Algorithmic Game Theory, and have enjoyed studying problems in Optimization, Combinatorics, and Aproximation Algorithms.

In the past year I have been working on obtaining a Fully Polynomial Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for the volume of a polytope. Our goal is to design a deterministic algorithm that can compute an epsilon multiplicative approximation of the volume of a polytope $P = \{x \in [0,1]^n : Ax \leq b\}. We have results when we assume entries of the constraint matrix $A$ are nonnegative, and we are currently working on eliminating this restriction. You can find more information about our results through our [poster](files/Volume_Poster.pdf).

In the Summer of 2023, I was accepted to the Distributed REU program with the Computing Research Association. I received funding to spend 10 weeks at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and work with Professor Ruta Mehta on research in Algorithmic Game Theory. We worked on the problem of Fair Allocation and explored different measurements of fairness in different problem settings. You can find more information about our results through our [paper](files/ApproximatingMMSandAPS.pdf) and [poster](files/Fairness_Poster.pdf).

In the Fall of 2022, I joined a research project with professor Eshan Chattopadhyay on Fourier Bounds for Parity Decision Trees (PTDs). The goal of this project is to improve current bounds on the complexity of Fourier expansions of boolean functions on binary strings. 

I plan to continue exploring research in Theoretical CS, Algorithms, Optimization, and more through pursuing a PhD.
