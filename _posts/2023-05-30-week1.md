During the first week of the DREU program, I read papers on Fairness measurements such as Envy-Freeness and Proportionality in https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02672. I met with Professor Mehta and another student, Arjun Aggarwal, and read on papers regarding Maixmin share 
(MMS for chores latest paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04581.pdf
MMS with goods and cardinality constraints: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07300) 
And decided to begin the project by focusing on the MMS measurement of fairness. We plan to continue by providing an approximation factor for which we can guarantee a distribution of goods with a cardinality constraint, using an algorithm composed of bagging and reductions.
